The stochastic competition learning program is an algorithm for testing domination parameters.
The data used is in "data_duibi". The data set is taken from SNAP.
The xlsx file is a different stage opinion network.
The "recurring random competition learning folder" has a set of procedures for reproducing the random competition learning algorithm and assisting the data. The algorithm has not been found in other open source code since the University of Sao Paulo, Brazil.
EM_MB_DL_PM.ipynb can implement four algorithms
随机竞争学习程序是检验控制参数方面算法改进的
用的数据是data_duibi里面的 该数据集采自SNAP
xlsx文件为不同阶段舆情网络
“复现随机竞争学习文件夹”有一整套复现了随机竞争学习算法的程序，并辅助数据。该算法自巴西圣保罗大学提出后未见有其他开源代码，欢迎交流使用。
